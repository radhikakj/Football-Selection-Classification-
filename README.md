# Football Selection Classification Project

This repository contains code for a football player selection classification project using the Random Forest Classifier. The project also includes hyperparameter tuning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) with correlation analysis.

## Project Overview

In this project, we aimed to predict whether a football player would be selected for a match or not based on various features such as age, playing position, performance statistics, etc. We utilized the Random Forest Classifier for this classification task, leveraging its ability to handle complex data and provide reliable predictions.





## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about football players, including their attributes and whether they were selected for matches or not. It is stored in the `data/` directory and is divided into training and testing sets.

## Results

The results obtained from the Random Forest Classifier, including accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and other evaluation metrics, are stored in the `results/` directory. These results provide insights into the model's performance and can be further analyzed for improvements.
